# SQL-for-Data-Analysis


# üõí SQL for Data Analysis ‚Äì Ecommerce_SQL_Database (Google Colab)

## üéØ Objective
To learn and apply SQL techniques to analyze an Ecommerce dataset using **Google Colab + SQLite**.

This project demonstrates how to:
- Create and manage relational tables  
- Use SQL queries to extract and analyze data  
- Perform aggregations, joins, subqueries, and create views  
- Optimize queries using indexes  

---

## üß∞ Tools Used
- **Google Colab** ‚Äî interactive notebook environment  
- **SQLite3** ‚Äî lightweight SQL database (no installation required)  
- **Pandas** ‚Äî to display query results as tables  

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset: Ecommerce_SQL_Database
The database contains 5 interconnected tables:

| Table | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **customers** | Customer details (name, city, signup date) |
| **products** | Product details (category, price) |
| **orders** | Order-level data (order date, total amount) |
| **order_items** | Product quantity per order |
| **shipping** | Shipping status and delivery details |

All tables and sample data are **automatically created** when you run the setup cell in Colab ‚Äî no external file needed.

## üß† SQL Tasks Performed

| # | Task | SQL Concept |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | View all customers | `SELECT` |
| 2 | Filter customers by city | `WHERE` |
| 3 | Count orders per customer | `JOIN`, `GROUP BY` |
| 4 | Find highest order value | `ORDER BY DESC`, `LIMIT` |
| 5 | Calculate average product price by category | `AVG()`, `GROUP BY` |
| 6 | Join multiple tables (order + product + shipping) | `INNER JOIN` |
| 7 | Identify top spenders (> ‚Çπ50,000) | Subquery, `HAVING` |
| 8 | Create customer spending summary | `CREATE VIEW` |
| 9 | Optimize query performance | `CREATE INDEX` |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run This Project in Google Colab

1. Open **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qLj8xx6t9NcP35Ls7l_aZuHGcc3SK9mv?usp=sharing)**  
2. Copy-paste the provided SQL + Python code cells  
3. Run each cell in order (Setup ‚Üí Create Tables ‚Üí Run Queries)  
4. View results directly in the output cells  
5. Take screenshots of query outputs for submission

## üì∏ Deliverables
- `Ecommerce_SQL_Database.db` (auto-created SQLite file)  
- `README.md` (this document)  
- Colab notebook (`.ipynb`)  
- Screenshots of query results  

---

## üèÅ Outcome
After completing this project, you will be able to:
- Work with relational data using SQL  
- Write complex queries with joins and subqueries  
- Summarize and analyze data using aggregate functions  
- Create views and indexes for better performance  
- Integrate SQL workflows seamlessly in Google Colab
